Open ./level0 with gdb

$ disas main
...
0x08048ed4 <+20>:	call   0x8049710 <atoi>
0x08048ed9 <+25>:	cmp    eax, 0x1a7
0x08048ede <+30>:	jne    0x8048f58 <main+152>
...

This shows that the value returned by atoi is compared to 0x1a7 (423).
All we need to do is run the program with 423.

$ ./level0 423
cd /home/user/level1
cat .pass
