The interesting thing about this program are these instructions :

buf[atoi(argv[1])] = '\0';
if (strcmp(buf, argv[1]) == 0)
	execl("/bin/sh", "sh", 0);

It simply means that is we pass "nothing" to the program, the first byte of buf will be set to null and it will compare "nothing" with "nothing".
We just have to do like so :

$ ./bonus3 ""
